 Compiled from different methods mentioned in other posts


In this repository, methods written in the python language are stored. the `GEOCODIGO` method is created to cross, in an aggregate way, the census microdata with its respective cartography in `.shp` format.
The `sql2df` method is used to connect to a database, make a query and then disconnect from that database. The output of the function is a pandas dataframe.
